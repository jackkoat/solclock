    "response": "## Research Complete ✅\n\nI have successfully researched and analyzed Solscan API endpoints to create a comprehensive comparison between free tier and premium tier usage. Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### **Key Findings:**\n\n**🔑 Tier Structure Discovered:**\n- **Free Tier**: 10M C.U/month, 1,000 requests/60s, attribution required\n- **Pro Level 2**: $129.35/month, 150M C.U, 1,000 requests/60s  \n- **Pro Level 3**: $259.35/month, 500M C.U, 2,000 requests/60s\n- **Pro Level 4**: $714.35/month, 1.5B C.U, 3,000 requests/60s\n\n**📊 Comprehensive Endpoint Analysis:**\n- **20+ Pro API endpoints** organized by 6 categories\n- **All endpoints cost 100 C.U per request** (simplified billing)\n- **Free tier severely limited** - most functionality requires Pro API\n- **No public API documentation** - all endpoints are Pro-only\n\n**⚠️ Major Limitations Identified:**\n- Token price data has 3-minute delay\n- Only top 2,000 tokens available by market cap\n- No testnet support\n- History limited to 3 years (transfers) or 6 months (DeFi activities)\n\n**💡 Strategic Recommendations:**\n- Use **free Solana RPC** alternatives for basic queries\n- **Optimize Pro API usage** with smart caching and batch processing\n- **Combine services** (Solscan Pro + free RPC) for best cost-efficiency\n- Consider **bulk purchasing** for 20-35% cost savings\n\n### **Deliverable Created:**\n📄 **Complete Analysis**: <filepath>docs/solscan_api_tier_analysis.md</filepath> - A 340+ line comprehensive report covering:\n- Detailed endpoint-by-endpoint comparison\n- Cost-benefit analysis for each tier\n- Best practices for optimization\n- Alternative approaches and recommendations\n- Implementation strategies\n\nThe analysis reveals that while Solscan Pro API provides comprehensive data access, most useful endpoints require paid subscriptions. However, strategic optimization can significantly extend free tier capabilities, and alternatives like public RPC endpoints can complement Solscan for cost-effective Solana blockchain access.",
